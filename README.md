## Applications of Simulator:

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
 $ conda env create -f environment.yml 
 $ conda activate ten
 $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3 (optional)
```

Finally, start Jupyter with a local machine:

```start 
 $ jupyter notebook
```

Or, start Jupyter with a remote server:
```start 
 $ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=<number>
```
